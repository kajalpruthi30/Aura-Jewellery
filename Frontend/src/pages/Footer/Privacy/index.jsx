Accordingly, we have a range of technical security measures and procedures in place to ensure that your personal information is protected appropriately. These include but are not limited to:</p>
                  <ul className='m-5 list-inside list-disc'>
                    <li className='m-5'>Restricting access to information systems through access control measures and authentication techniques;</li>
                    <li className='m-5'>Encrypting sensitive data while at rest and in transmission;</li>
                    <li className='m-5'>Providing information security training to internal employees; and</li>

                  <p className='m-5'>Your Personal Data will be kept on databases held on servers kept in a physically and technologically secured environment, accessed only by authorised personnel or contractors. </p>

                  <p className='m-5'>You are neither legally nor contractually obliged to provide your Personal Data (including any sensitive information).</p>
                  <p className='m-5'>However, the provision of your Personal Data is necessary to a certain extent so that we can provide you with the functions on our website and our services. In particular, the provision of your Personal Data is necessary to enable us to receive and process your enquiries, to enable us to initiate or execute contracts, and to enable you to use the community functions in connection with our social media presences.</p>
                  <p className='m-5'>If it is necessary to provide your data, we will indicate this by marking the relevant field as mandatory. The provision of further Personal Data is voluntary. In the case of required Personal Data, failure to provide this Personal Data will result in Lovisa not being able to provide the corresponding functions and services, in particular we will not be able to receive and process your enquiries and/or enable the initiation or execution of a contract. Furthermore, you will not be able to use the community functions of our social media sites. If you do not provide us with the required Personal Data in connection with your application, we will not be able to consider your application. Insofar as voluntary information is concerned, the failure to provide it means that we cannot provide the corresponding functions and services or cannot provide them to the usual extent.</p>

                  <p className='m-5'>Your data will only be processed for purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy if this is permitted by law or if you have consented to the changed purpose of the data processing. In the event of further processing for purposes other than those for which the data was originally collected, we will inform you of these other purposes prior to further processing and provide you with all other relevant information.</p>

                  <p className='m-5'>Unless otherwise stated within this Privacy Policy, we will delete or anonymise your Personal Data as soon as it is no longer required for Lovisa to achieve the purpose for which we collected or used your Personal Data.</p>
                  <p className='m-5'>Insofar as Lovisa is legally obliged to store your Personal Data, we also store it for the legally required period (Art 6 para 1 lit c) GDPR). Legal storage requirements may arise in particular from the retention periods (e.g. the German Commercial Code (HGB) or the German Fiscal Code (AO). The retention period according to these regulations is usually between 6 and 10 years from the end of the year in which the corresponding process was completed, e.g., we have finally processed your enquiry, or the contract has ended or your piercing was completed. Your Personal Data will then be archived to be used in the event of a litigation or dispute for the statute of limitation term applicable to the related purpose. If a judicial action is initiated, the personal information may be stored until the end of such action, including any potential periods for appeal, and will then be deleted or archived as permitted by applicable law. The storage is based on our legitimate interest, the proper documentation of our business operations and the protection of our legal positions (Art 6 para 1 lit f) GDPR). If your Personal Data is relevant to the initiation of a contract or the execution of contracts, it is stored for the initiation and execution of the respective contractual relationship (Art 6 para 1 lit b GDPR).</p>

                  <p className='m-5'>You can contact our Privacy Officer using the contact details in the contact section of this Privacy Policy and we will provide you with your Personal Data via e-mail.</p>

                  <p className='m-5'>You have the right to object to the processing of your Personal Data that is done based upon Art 6 para 1 lite for  GDPR (Art 6 para 1 lit f) GDPR being Lovisa’s legitimate interests. Lovisa will not continue to process the Personal Data unless we can demonstrate a legitimate ground which overrides your interest and rights, or due to legal claims.</p>
                  <p className='m-5'>You also have the right to object to direct marketing. You can opt out from Lovisa’s direct marketing by following the instructions contained in each marketing e-mail. After your objection, we will stop the processing.</p>

                  <p className='m-5'><strong>17.4 RIGHT TO RESTRICTION</strong></p>
                  <p className='m-5'>In limited circumstances, you have the right to request that Lovisa restricts the processing of your Personal Data. These circumstances include:</p>

                  <ul className='m-5 ml-10 list-inside list-disc'>
                    <li className='m-5'>If you object to a processing based on Lovisa’s legitimate interest, in which case Lovisa shall restrict all processing the data pending the verification of the legitimate interest;</li>
                    <li className='m-5'>If your Personal Data is incorrect, in which case Lovisa will restrict the processing of your data pending verification of the accuracy of your Personal Data; and</li>
                    <li className='m-5'>If the processing is unlawful, in which case you can request restriction of your Personal Data as opposed to deletion.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p className='m-5'>If Lovisa no longer requires your Personal Data but it is required by you to defend legal claims. We process the Personal Data you provide Lovisa when making use of your aforementioned rights for the purpose enabling these rights and to be able to provide proof thereof. This processing is based on the legal basis of Art 6 para 1 lit c) GDPR in conjunction with Art 15 - 22 GDPR and Section 34 para 2 German Federal Data Protection Act (“BDSG”).</p>

                  <p className='m-5 '><strong>17.5 RIGHT TO DATA PORTABILITY</strong></p>

                  <p className='m-5'>This only applies to information you have given us. You have the right to ask that we transfer the information you gave us from one organisation to another or give it to you. The right only applies if we are processing information based on your consent or under, or in talks about entering into a contract and the processing is automated.</p>
